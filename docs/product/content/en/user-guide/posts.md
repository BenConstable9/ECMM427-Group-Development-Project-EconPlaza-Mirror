A post is where discussions happen within the site. 

Users can create posts within a plaza. A post consists of the original poster's body of content, and a comments section with replies and discussions related to the post.

### Creating a post

Any user can create a post. They must provide a title, a body of content, and then tag it in order to allow other users to discover it more easily.
