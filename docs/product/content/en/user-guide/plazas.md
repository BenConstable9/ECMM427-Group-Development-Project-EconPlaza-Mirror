A plaza is a community within the site. This is where users post content and have discussions. 

Plazas tend to be relevent to a theme or community. For example, the University of Exeter plaza is used by staff and students at the university.

### Creating a plaza

Any user can create a plaza, as long as they provide a unique slug. This slug will be used in the URL of the plaza.
