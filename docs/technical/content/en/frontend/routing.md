## Static routes

Routes are automatically generated by Nuxt based on files discovered within the `pages/` directory. In order to create a new page in the application, you just need to create a new file.

For example, the existence of this file:

```
frontend/pages/login.vue
```

Will result in this route:

```
/login
```

An `index.vue` file within a named directory will have the same effect as naming the file. For example, the above path has an identical result to:

```
frontend/pages/login/index.vue
```

## Dynamic routes

Some routes are dynamic. For example, a user's profile page is located at:

```
/users/1
```

You can treat a dynamic part of the route as a parameter by using an underscore:

frontend\frontend\pages\users\_id.vue

The parameter can then be used in the component's logic. In this case, we fetch from the API's user profile method using the ID.
